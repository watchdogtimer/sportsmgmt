== Sports Management

Sportsmgmt is a Rails application that makes league (and soon tournament)
registration simple and quick. It also handles rostering. This is an early
version and there is a vast amount of room for improvement. The focus of the
development has been on User/Player registration and League creation.


== Installation

Installation on your local computer is straightforward if you are familiar with
Rails applications.

*Get the application
	`git clone git@github.com:watchdogtimer/sportsmgmt.git`
	
*Create database and migrate
	`cd sportsmgmt`
	`rake db:create;rake db:migrate`

*Run the application, then navigate to [http://localhost:3000]
	`rails server`
	
== Setting Up Application

There are some hardcodings that will go away eventually (such as the homepage).
For now, the way to set up the application is to register yourself as a user,
then navigate to your leagues. Once you've registered you need to create an
Organization which will 'own' leagues. From there you can create a league and
users can begin to register for your leagues.
